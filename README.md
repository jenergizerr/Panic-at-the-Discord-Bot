# Panic in the Discord 

Discord bot so you can send your PFPS to MickyD's to survive the dip!! 

feel free to rename your outfits --> this will work for any pfp collection on OS, no need to download the images (hit me up for a version that works with images hosted on an alt site if you need)

1) update .env with your bot token from discord.  
2) set up to server via discord link.  

3) python3 main.py. 

deploy on heroku. * free heroku is ending on Nov 28th, though depending on discord activity you will probably need to upgrade to a paid teir anyways*
https://www.heroku.com/

4) change runtime to match their standard. 

!help for commands. 

!apply werq 666 (ex. command)
